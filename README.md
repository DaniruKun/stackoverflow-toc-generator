# Stackoverflow ToC Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Stackoverflow unfortunately does not have an automatic Table of Contents (ToC) generator, which is the reason for this small project.
In addition, Stackoverflow uses a custom MarkDown flavour which requires a special prefix for heading links.
